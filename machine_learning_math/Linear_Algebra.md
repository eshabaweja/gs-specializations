- Another type of problem we might be interested in is fitting an equation to some data.
- Solving **simultaneous equations**. 

- In fact, with neural networks and machine learning, we want the computer in effect not only to fit the equation, but to figure out what is the best equation to use. 
- how to find the **optimal value** of the parameters in the equation describing this line. 

### Vectors

Gaussian (Normal) Distribution

- width of sigma
- center of mu
- normalized so that it's area is 1

- in Computer Science, vectors may be represented as lists.
- Vectors can be thought of in a variety of different ways - some geometrically, some algebraically, some numerically.

- One of the tasks of machine learning is to **fit a model to data** in order to represent the underlying distribution.
- **keywords:** model, measured data, parameters.
- One way of fitting is to calculate the "**residuals**", which is the difference between the measured data and the modelled prediction for each histogram bin.
- A better fit would have as much **overlap** as it can, reducing the residuals as much as possible.

- The performance of a model can be quantified in a single number. One measure we can use is the *Sum of Squared Residuals*, SSR.

- The first goal when solving simple simultaneous equations should be to **isolate one of the variables**.
- There is also the substitution method, where we rearrange one of the equations to the form `x=ay+b` or `y=cx+d` and then substitute x or y into the other equation.
- **Vector Addition:** The head-to-tail method of adding vectors involves drawing the first vector on a graph and then placing the tail of each subsequent vector at the head of the previous vector. The **resultant** vector is then drawn from the **tail of the first** vector to the **head of the final** vector.
